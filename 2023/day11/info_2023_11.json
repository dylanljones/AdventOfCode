        "text": "You continue following signs for \"Hot Springs\" and eventually come across an observatory.\nThe Elf within turns out to be a researcher studying cosmic expansion using the giant telescope here.\n\nHe doesn't know anything about the missing machine parts; he's only visiting for this research project.\nHowever, he confirms that the hot springs are the next-closest area likely to have people; he'll even take you straight there once he's done with today's observation analysis.\n\nMaybe you can help him with the analysis to speed things up?\n\nThe researcher has collected a bunch of data and compiled the data into a single giant image (your puzzle input).\nThe image includes empty space (.) and galaxies (#).\nFor example:\n\n...#......\n.......#..\n#.........\n..........\n......#...\n.#........\n.........#\n..........\n.......#..\n#...#.....\n\nThe researcher is trying to figure out the sum of the lengths of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies.\nHowever, there's a catch: the universe expanded in the time it took the light from those galaxies to reach the observatory.\n\nDue to something involving gravitational effects, only some space expands.\nIn fact, the result is that any rows or columns that contain no galaxies should all actually be twice as big.\n\nIn the above example, three columns and two rows contain no galaxies:\n\nv  v  v\n ...#......\n .......#..\n #.........\n>..........<\n ......#...\n .#........\n .........#\n>..........<\n .......#..\n #...#.....\n   ^  ^  ^\n\nThese rows and columns need to be twice as big; the result of cosmic expansion therefore looks like this:\n\n....#........\n.........#...\n#............\n.............\n.............\n........#....\n.#...........\n............#\n.............\n.............\n.........#...\n#....#.......\n\nEquipped with this expanded universe, the shortest path between every pair of galaxies can be found.\nIt can help to assign every galaxy a unique number:\n\n....1........\n.........2...\n3............\n.............\n.............\n........4....\n.5...........\n............6\n.............\n.............\n.........7...\n8....9.......\n\nIn these 9 galaxies, there are 36 pairs.\nOnly count each pair once; order within the pair doesn't matter.\nFor each pair, find any shortest path between the two galaxies using only steps that move up, down, left, or right exactly one .\nor # at a time.\n(The shortest path between two galaxies is allowed to pass through another galaxy.)\n\nFor example, here is one of the shortest paths between galaxies 5 and 9:\n\n....1........\n.........2...\n3............\n.............\n.............\n........4....\n.5...........\n.##.........6\n..##.........\n...##........\n....##...7...\n8....9.......\n\nThis path has length 9 because it takes a minimum of nine steps to get from galaxy 5 to galaxy 9 (the eight locations marked # plus the step onto galaxy 9 itself).\nHere are some other example shortest path lengths:\n\nBetween galaxy 1 and galaxy 7: 15\nBetween galaxy 3 and galaxy 6: 17\nBetween galaxy 8 and galaxy 9: 5\n\nIn this example, after expanding the universe, the sum of the shortest path between all 36 pairs of galaxies is 374.\n\nExpand the universe, then find the length of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies.\nWhat is the sum of these lengths?",

        "text": "The galaxies are much older (and thus much farther apart) than the researcher initially estimated.\n\nNow, instead of the expansion you did before, make each empty row or column one million times larger.\nThat is, each empty row should be replaced with 1000000 empty rows, and each empty column should be replaced with 1000000 empty columns.\n\n(In the example above, if each empty row or column were merely 10 times larger, the sum of the shortest paths between every pair of galaxies would be 1030.\nIf each empty row or column were merely 100 times larger, the sum of the shortest paths between every pair of galaxies would be 8410.\nHowever, your universe will need to expand far beyond these values.)\n\nStarting with the same initial image, expand the universe according to these new rules, then find the length of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies.\nWhat is the sum of these lengths?",
