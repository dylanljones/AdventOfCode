        "text": "Your all-expenses-paid trip turns out to be a one-way, five-minute ride in an airship.\n(At least it's a cool airship!) It drops you off at the edge of a vast desert and descends back to Island Island.\n\n\"Did you bring the parts?\"\n\nYou turn around to see an Elf completely covered in white clothing, wearing goggles, and riding a large camel.\n\n\"Did you bring the parts?\" she asks again, louder this time.\nYou aren't sure what parts she's looking for; you're here to figure out why the sand stopped.\n\n\"The parts! For the sand, yes! Come with me; I will show you.\" She beckons you onto the camel.\n\nAfter riding a bit across the sands of Desert Island, you can see what look like very large rocks covering half of the horizon.\nThe Elf explains that the rocks are all along the part of Desert Island that is directly above Island Island, making it hard to even get there.\nNormally, they use big machines to move the rocks and filter the sand, but the machines have broken down because Desert Island recently stopped receiving the parts they need to fix the machines.\n\nYou've already assumed it'll be your job to figure out why the parts stopped when she asks if you can help.\nYou agree automatically.\n\nBecause the journey will take a few days, she offers to teach you the game of Camel Cards.\nCamel Cards is sort of similar to poker except it's designed to be easier to play while riding a camel.\n\nIn Camel Cards, you get a list of hands, and your goal is to order them based on the strength of each hand.\nA hand consists of five cards labeled one of A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2.\nThe relative strength of each card follows this order, where A is the highest and 2 is the lowest.\n\nEvery hand is exactly one type.\nFrom strongest to weakest, they are:\n\nFive of a kind, where all five cards have the same label: AAAAA\nFour of a kind, where four cards have the same label and one card has a different label: AA8AA\nFull house, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards share a different label: 23332\nThree of a kind, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards are each different from any other card in the hand: TTT98\nTwo pair, where two cards share one label, two other cards share a second label, and the remaining card has a third label: 23432\nOne pair, where two cards share one label, and the other three cards have a different label from the pair and each other: A23A4\nHigh card, where all cards' labels are distinct: 23456\n\nHands are primarily ordered based on type; for example, every full house is stronger than any three of a kind.\n\nIf two hands have the same type, a second ordering rule takes effect.\nStart by comparing the first card in each hand.\nIf these cards are different, the hand with the stronger first card is considered stronger.\nIf the first card in each hand have the same label, however, then move on to considering the second card in each hand.\nIf they differ, the hand with the higher second card wins; otherwise, continue with the third card in each hand, then the fourth, then the fifth.\n\nSo, 33332 and 2AAAA are both four of a kind hands, but 33332 is stronger because its first card is stronger.\nSimilarly, 77888 and 77788 are both a full house, but 77888 is stronger because its third card is stronger (and both hands have the same first and second card).\n\nTo play Camel Cards, you are given a list of hands and their corresponding bid (your puzzle input).\nFor example:\n\n32T3K 765\nT55J5 684\nKK677 28\nKTJJT 220\nQQQJA 483\n\nThis example shows five hands; each hand is followed by its bid amount.\nEach hand wins an amount equal to its bid multiplied by its rank, where the weakest hand gets rank 1, the second-weakest hand gets rank 2, and so on up to the strongest hand.\nBecause there are five hands in this example, the strongest hand will have rank 5 and its bid will be multiplied by 5.\n\nSo, the first step is to put the hands in order of strength:\n\n32T3K is the only one pair and the other hands are all a stronger type, so it gets rank 1.\nKK677 and KTJJT are both two pair.\nTheir first cards both have the same label, but the second card of KK677 is stronger (K vs T), so KTJJT gets rank 2 and KK677 gets rank 3.\nT55J5 and QQQJA are both three of a kind.\nQQQJA has a stronger first card, so it gets rank 5 and T55J5 gets rank 4.\n\nNow, you can determine the total winnings of this set of hands by adding up the result of multiplying each hand's bid with its rank (765 * 1 + 220 * 2 + 28 * 3 + 684 * 4 + 483 * 5).\nSo the total winnings in this example are 6440.\n\nFind the rank of every hand in your set.\nWhat are the total winnings?",

        "text": "To make things a little more interesting, the Elf introduces one additional rule.\nNow, J cards are jokers - wildcards that can act like whatever card would make the hand the strongest type possible.\n\nTo balance this, J cards are now the weakest individual cards, weaker even than 2.\nThe other cards stay in the same order: A, K, Q, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, J.\n\nJ cards can pretend to be whatever card is best for the purpose of determining hand type; for example, QJJQ2 is now considered four of a kind.\nHowever, for the purpose of breaking ties between two hands of the same type, J is always treated as J, not the card it's pretending to be: JKKK2 is weaker than QQQQ2 because J is weaker than Q.\n\nNow, the above example goes very differently:\n\n32T3K 765\nT55J5 684\nKK677 28\nKTJJT 220\nQQQJA 483\n\n32T3K is still the only one pair; it doesn't contain any jokers, so its strength doesn't increase.\nKK677 is now the only two pair, making it the second-weakest hand.\nT55J5, KTJJT, and QQQJA are now all four of a kind! T55J5 gets rank 3, QQQJA gets rank 4, and KTJJT gets rank 5.\n\nWith the new joker rule, the total winnings in this example are 5905.\n\nUsing the new joker rule, find the rank of every hand in your set.\nWhat are the new total winnings?",
