        "text": "You finally decode the Elves' message.\nHI, the message says.\nYou continue searching for the sleigh keys.\n\nAhead of you is what appears to be a large ocean trench.\nCould the keys have fallen into it? You'd better send a probe to investigate.\n\nThe probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any integer velocity in the x (forward) and y (upward, or downward if negative) directions.\nFor example, an initial x,y velocity like 0,10 would fire the probe straight up, while an initial velocity like 10,-1 would fire the probe forward at a slight downward angle.\n\nThe probe's x,y position starts at 0,0.\nThen, it will follow some trajectory by moving in steps.\nOn each step, these changes occur in the following order:\n\nThe probe's x position increases by its x velocity.\nThe probe's y position increases by its y velocity.\nDue to drag, the probe's x velocity changes by 1 toward the value 0; that is, it decreases by 1 if it is greater than 0, increases by 1 if it is less than 0, or does not change if it is already 0.\nDue to gravity, the probe's y velocity decreases by 1.\n\nFor the probe to successfully make it into the trench, the probe must be on some trajectory that causes it to be within a target area after any step.\nThe submarine computer has already calculated this target area (your puzzle input).\nFor example:\n\ntarget area: x=20..30, y=-10..-5\n\nThis target area means that you need to find initial x,y velocity values such that after any step, the probe's x position is at least 20 and at most 30, and the probe's y position is at least -10 and at most -5.\n\nGiven this target area, one initial velocity that causes the probe to be within the target area after any step is 7,2:\n\n.............#....#............\n.......#..............#........\n...............................\nS........................#.....\n...............................\n...............................\n...........................#...\n...............................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTT#TT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n\nIn this diagram, S is the probe's initial position, 0,0.\nThe x coordinate increases to the right, and the y coordinate increases upward.\nIn the bottom right, positions that are within the target area are shown as T.\nAfter each step (until the target area is reached), the position of the probe is marked with #.\n(The bottom-right # is both a position the probe reaches and a position in the target area.)\n\nAnother initial velocity that causes the probe to be within the target area after any step is 6,3:\n\n...............#..#............\n...........#........#..........\n...............................\n......#..............#.........\n...............................\n...............................\nS....................#.........\n...............................\n...............................\n...............................\n.....................#.........\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................T#TTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n\nAnother one is 9,0:\n\nS........#.....................\n.................#.............\n...............................\n........................#......\n...............................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTT#\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n\nOne initial velocity that doesn't cause the probe to be within the target area after any step is 17,-4:\n\nS..............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n.................#.............................................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT..#.............................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n................................................#..............\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n..............................................................#\n\nThe probe appears to pass through the target area, but is never within it after any step.\nInstead, it continues down and to the right - only the first few steps are shown.\n\nIf you're going to fire a highly scientific probe out of a super cool probe launcher, you might as well do it with style.\nHow high can you make the probe go while still reaching the target area?\n\nIn the above example, using an initial velocity of 6,9 is the best you can do, causing the probe to reach a maximum y position of 45.\n(Any higher initial y velocity causes the probe to overshoot the target area entirely.)\n\nFind the initial velocity that causes the probe to reach the highest y position and still eventually be within the target area after any step.\nWhat is the highest y position it reaches on this trajectory?",
