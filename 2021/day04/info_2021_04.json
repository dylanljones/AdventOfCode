        "text": "You're already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean, already so deep that you can't see any sunlight.\nWhat you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.\n\nMaybe it wants to play bingo?\n\nBingo is played on a set of boards each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers.\nNumbers are chosen at random, and the chosen number is marked on all boards on which it appears.\n(Numbers may not appear on all boards.) If all numbers in any row or any column of a board are marked, that board wins.\n(Diagonals don't count.)\n\nThe submarine has a bingo subsystem to help passengers (currently, you and the giant squid) pass the time.\nIt automatically generates a random order in which to draw numbers and a random set of boards (your puzzle input).\nFor example:\n\n7,4,9,5,11,17,23,2,0,14,21,24,10,16,13,6,15,25,12,22,18,20,8,19,3,26,1\n\n22 13 17 11  0\n 8  2 23  4 24\n21  9 14 16  7\n 6 10  3 18  5\n 1 12 20 15 19\n\n 3 15  0  2 22\n 9 18 13 17  5\n19  8  7 25 23\n20 11 10 24  4\n14 21 16 12  6\n\n14 21 17 24  4\n10 16 15  9 19\n18  8 23 26 20\n22 11 13  6  5\n 2  0 12  3  7\n\nAfter the first five numbers are drawn (7, 4, 9, 5, and 11), there are no winners, but the boards are marked as follows (shown here adjacent to each other to save space):\n\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\n\nAfter the next six numbers are drawn (17, 23, 2, 0, 14, and 21), there are still no winners:\n\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\n\nFinally, 24 is drawn:\n\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\n\nAt this point, the third board wins because it has at least one complete row or column of marked numbers (in this case, the entire top row is marked: 14 21 17 24  4).\n\nThe score of the winning board can now be calculated.\nStart by finding the sum of all unmarked numbers on that board; in this case, the sum is 188.\nThen, multiply that sum by the number that was just called when the board won, 24, to get the final score, 188 * 24 = 4512.\n\nTo guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which board will win first.\nWhat will your final score be if you choose that board?",
