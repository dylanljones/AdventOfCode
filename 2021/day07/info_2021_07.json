        "text": "A giant whale has decided your submarine is its next meal, and it's much faster than you are.\nThere's nowhere to run!\n\nSuddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it's too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a massive underground cave system just beyond where they're aiming!\n\nThe crab submarines all need to be aligned before they'll have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through.\nHowever, it doesn't look like they'll be aligned before the whale catches you! Maybe you can help?\n\nThere's one major catch - crab submarines can only move horizontally.\n\nYou quickly make a list of the horizontal position of each crab (your puzzle input).\nCrab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible.\n\nFor example, consider the following horizontal positions:\n\n16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14\n\nThis means there's a crab with horizontal position 16, a crab with horizontal position 1, and so on.\n\nEach change of 1 step in horizontal position of a single crab costs 1 fuel.\nYou could choose any horizontal position to align them all on, but the one that costs the least fuel is horizontal position 2:\n\nMove from 16 to 2: 14 fuel\nMove from 1 to 2: 1 fuel\nMove from 2 to 2: 0 fuel\nMove from 0 to 2: 2 fuel\nMove from 4 to 2: 2 fuel\nMove from 2 to 2: 0 fuel\nMove from 7 to 2: 5 fuel\nMove from 1 to 2: 1 fuel\nMove from 2 to 2: 0 fuel\nMove from 14 to 2: 12 fuel\n\nThis costs a total of 37 fuel.\nThis is the cheapest possible outcome; more expensive outcomes include aligning at position 1 (41 fuel), position 3 (39 fuel), or position 10 (71 fuel).\n\nDetermine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible.\nHow much fuel must they spend to align to that position?",

        "text": "The crabs don't seem interested in your proposed solution.\nPerhaps you misunderstand crab engineering?\n\nAs it turns out, crab submarine engines don't burn fuel at a constant rate.\nInstead, each change of 1 step in horizontal position costs 1 more unit of fuel than the last: the first step costs 1, the second step costs 2, the third step costs 3, and so on.\n\nAs each crab moves, moving further becomes more expensive.\nThis changes the best horizontal position to align them all on; in the example above, this becomes 5:\n\nMove from 16 to 5: 66 fuel\nMove from 1 to 5: 10 fuel\nMove from 2 to 5: 6 fuel\nMove from 0 to 5: 15 fuel\nMove from 4 to 5: 1 fuel\nMove from 2 to 5: 6 fuel\nMove from 7 to 5: 3 fuel\nMove from 1 to 5: 10 fuel\nMove from 2 to 5: 6 fuel\nMove from 14 to 5: 45 fuel\n\nThis costs a total of 168 fuel.\nThis is the new cheapest possible outcome; the old alignment position (2) now costs 206 fuel instead.\n\nDetermine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible so they can make you an escape route!
