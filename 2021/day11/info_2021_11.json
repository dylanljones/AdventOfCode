        "text": "You enter a large cavern full of rare bioluminescent dumbo octopuses! They seem to not like the Christmas lights on your submarine, so you turn them off for now.\n\nThere are 100 octopuses arranged neatly in a 10 by 10 grid.\nEach octopus slowly gains energy over time and flashes brightly for a moment when its energy is full.\nAlthough your lights are off, maybe you could navigate through the cave without disturbing the octopuses if you could predict when the flashes of light will happen.\n\nEach octopus has an energy level - your submarine can remotely measure the energy level of each octopus (your puzzle input).\nFor example:\n\n5483143223\n2745854711\n5264556173\n6141336146\n6357385478\n4167524645\n2176841721\n6882881134\n4846848554\n5283751526\n\nThe energy level of each octopus is a value between 0 and 9.\nHere, the top-left octopus has an energy level of 5, the bottom-right one has an energy level of 6, and so on.\n\nYou can model the energy levels and flashes of light in steps.\nDuring a single step, the following occurs:\n\nFirst, the energy level of each octopus increases by 1.\nThen, any octopus with an energy level greater than 9 flashes.\nThis increases the energy level of all adjacent octopuses by 1, including octopuses that are diagonally adjacent.\nIf this causes an octopus to have an energy level greater than 9, it also flashes.\nThis process continues as long as new octopuses keep having their energy level increased beyond 9.\n(An octopus can only flash at most once per step.)\nFinally, any octopus that flashed during this step has its energy level set to 0, as it used all of its energy to flash.\n\nAdjacent flashes can cause an octopus to flash on a step even if it begins that step with very little energy.\nConsider the middle octopus with 1 energy in this situation:\n\nBefore any steps:\n11111\n19991\n19191\n19991\n11111\n\nAfter step 1:\n34543\n40004\n50005\n40004\n34543\n\nAfter step 2:\n45654\n51115\n61116\n51115\n45654\n\nAn octopus is highlighted when it flashed during the given step.\n\nHere is how the larger example above progresses:\n\nBefore any steps:\n5483143223\n2745854711\n5264556173\n6141336146\n6357385478\n4167524645\n2176841721\n6882881134\n4846848554\n5283751526\n\nAfter step 1:\n6594254334\n3856965822\n6375667284\n7252447257\n7468496589\n5278635756\n3287952832\n7993992245\n5957959665\n6394862637\n\nAfter step 2:\n8807476555\n5089087054\n8597889608\n8485769600\n8700908800\n6600088989\n6800005943\n0000007456\n9000000876\n8700006848\n\nAfter step 3:\n0050900866\n8500800575\n9900000039\n9700000041\n9935080063\n7712300000\n7911250009\n2211130000\n0421125000\n0021119000\n\nAfter step 4:\n2263031977\n0923031697\n0032221150\n0041111163\n0076191174\n0053411122\n0042361120\n5532241122\n1532247211\n1132230211\n\nAfter step 5:\n4484144000\n2044144000\n2253333493\n1152333274\n1187303285\n1164633233\n1153472231\n6643352233\n2643358322\n2243341322\n\nAfter step 6:\n5595255111\n3155255222\n3364444605\n2263444496\n2298414396\n2275744344\n2264583342\n7754463344\n3754469433\n3354452433\n\nAfter step 7:\n6707366222\n4377366333\n4475555827\n3496655709\n3500625609\n3509955566\n3486694453\n8865585555\n4865580644\n4465574644\n\nAfter step 8:\n7818477333\n5488477444\n5697666949\n4608766830\n4734946730\n4740097688\n6900007564\n0000009666\n8000004755\n6800007755\n\nAfter step 9:\n9060000644\n7800000976\n6900000080\n5840000082\n5858000093\n6962400000\n8021250009\n2221130009\n9111128097\n7911119976\n\nAfter step 10:\n0481112976\n0031112009\n0041112504\n0081111406\n0099111306\n0093511233\n0442361130\n5532252350\n0532250600\n0032240000\n\nAfter step 10, there have been a total of 204 flashes.\nFast forwarding, here is the same configuration every 10 steps:\n\nAfter step 20:\n3936556452\n5686556806\n4496555690\n4448655580\n4456865570\n5680086577\n7000009896\n0000000344\n6000000364\n4600009543\n\nAfter step 30:\n0643334118\n4253334611\n3374333458\n2225333337\n2229333338\n2276733333\n2754574565\n5544458511\n9444447111\n7944446119\n\nAfter step 40:\n6211111981\n0421111119\n0042111115\n0003111115\n0003111116\n0065611111\n0532351111\n3322234597\n2222222976\n2222222762\n\nAfter step 50:\n9655556447\n4865556805\n4486555690\n4458655580\n4574865570\n5700086566\n6000009887\n8000000533\n6800000633\n5680000538\n\nAfter step 60:\n2533334200\n2743334640\n2264333458\n2225333337\n2225333338\n2287833333\n3854573455\n1854458611\n1175447111\n1115446111\n\nAfter step 70:\n8211111164\n0421111166\n0042111114\n0004211115\n0000211116\n0065611111\n0532351111\n7322235117\n5722223475\n4572222754\n\nAfter step 80:\n1755555697\n5965555609\n4486555680\n4458655580\n4570865570\n5700086566\n7000008666\n0000000990\n0000000800\n0000000000\n\nAfter step 90:\n7433333522\n2643333522\n2264333458\n2226433337\n2222433338\n2287833333\n2854573333\n4854458333\n3387779333\n3333333333\n\nAfter step 100:\n0397666866\n0749766918\n0053976933\n0004297822\n0004229892\n0053222877\n0532222966\n9322228966\n7922286866\n6789998766\n\nAfter 100 steps, there have been a total of 1656 flashes.\n\nGiven the starting energy levels of the dumbo octopuses in your cavern, simulate 100 steps.\nHow many total flashes are there after 100 steps?",
