        "text": "You come across a field of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor! These vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if possible.\n\nThey tend to form in lines; the submarine helpfully produces a list of nearby lines of vents (your puzzle input) for you to review.\nFor example:\n\n0,9 -> 5,9\n8,0 -> 0,8\n9,4 -> 3,4\n2,2 -> 2,1\n7,0 -> 7,4\n6,4 -> 2,0\n0,9 -> 2,9\n3,4 -> 1,4\n0,0 -> 8,8\n5,5 -> 8,2\n\nEach line of vents is given as a line segment in the format x1,y1 -> x2,y2 where x1,y1 are the coordinates of one end the line segment and x2,y2 are the coordinates of the other end.\nThese line segments include the points at both ends.\nIn other words:\n\nAn entry like 1,1 -> 1,3 covers points 1,1, 1,2, and 1,3.\nAn entry like 9,7 -> 7,7 covers points 9,7, 8,7, and 7,7.\n\nFor now, only consider horizontal and vertical lines: lines where either x1 = x2 or y1 = y2.\n\nSo, the horizontal and vertical lines from the above list would produce the following diagram:\n\n.......1..\n..1....1..\n..1....1..\n.......1..\n.112111211\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n222111....\n\nIn this diagram, the top left corner is 0,0 and the bottom right corner is 9,9.\nEach position is shown as the number of lines which cover that point or .\nif no line covers that point.\nThe top-left pair of 1s, for example, comes from 2,2 -> 2,1; the very bottom row is formed by the overlapping lines 0,9 -> 5,9 and 0,9 -> 2,9.\n\nTo avoid the most dangerous areas, you need to determine the number of points where at least two lines overlap.\nIn the above example, this is anywhere in the diagram with a 2 or larger - a total of 5 points.\n\nConsider only horizontal and vertical lines.\nAt how many points do at least two lines overlap?",
