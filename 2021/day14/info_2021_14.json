        "text": "The incredible pressures at this depth are starting to put a strain on your submarine.\nThe submarine has polymerization equipment that would produce suitable materials to reinforce the submarine, and the nearby volcanically-active caves should even have the necessary input elements in sufficient quantities.\n\nThe submarine manual contains instructions for finding the optimal polymer formula; specifically, it offers a polymer template and a list of pair insertion rules (your puzzle input).\nYou just need to work out what polymer would result after repeating the pair insertion process a few times.\n\nFor example:\n\nNNCB\n\nCH -> B\nHH -> N\nCB -> H\nNH -> C\nHB -> C\nHC -> B\nHN -> C\nNN -> C\nBH -> H\nNC -> B\nNB -> B\nBN -> B\nBB -> N\nBC -> B\nCC -> N\nCN -> C\n\nThe first line is the polymer template - this is the starting point of the process.\n\nThe following section defines the pair insertion rules.\nA rule like AB -> C means that when elements A and B are immediately adjacent, element C should be inserted between them.\nThese insertions all happen simultaneously.\n\nSo, starting with the polymer template NNCB, the first step simultaneously considers all three pairs:\n\nThe first pair (NN) matches the rule NN -> C, so element C is inserted between the first N and the second N.\nThe second pair (NC) matches the rule NC -> B, so element B is inserted between the N and the C.\nThe third pair (CB) matches the rule CB -> H, so element H is inserted between the C and the B.\n\nNote that these pairs overlap: the second element of one pair is the first element of the next pair.\nAlso, because all pairs are considered simultaneously, inserted elements are not considered to be part of a pair until the next step.\n\nAfter the first step of this process, the polymer becomes NCNBCHB.\n\nHere are the results of a few steps using the above rules:\n\nTemplate:     NNCB\nAfter step 1: NCNBCHB\nAfter step 2: NBCCNBBBCBHCB\nAfter step 3: NBBBCNCCNBBNBNBBCHBHHBCHB\nAfter step 4: NBBNBNBBCCNBCNCCNBBNBBNBBBNBBNBBCBHCBHHNHCBBCBHCB\n\nThis polymer grows quickly.\nAfter step 5, it has length 97; After step 10, it has length 3073.\nAfter step 10, B occurs 1749 times, C occurs 298 times, H occurs 161 times, and N occurs 865 times; taking the quantity of the most common element (B, 1749) and subtracting the quantity of the least common element (H, 161) produces 1749 - 161 = 1588.\n\nApply 10 steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the most and least common elements in the result.\nWhat do you get if you take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity of the least common element?",
