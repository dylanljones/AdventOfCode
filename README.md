===================

## About

For 2022, I'm planning to implement the Advent of Code challenges mainly in python and some other languages... maybe.

## Timing

- comparing to these numbers isn't necessarily useful
- normalize your timing to day 1 part 1 and compare
- these timings are very non-scientific (sample size 1)
