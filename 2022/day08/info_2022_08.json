        "text": "The expedition comes across a peculiar patch of tall trees all planted carefully in a grid.\nThe Elves explain that a previous expedition planted these trees as a reforestation effort.\nNow, they're curious if this would be a good location for a tree house.\n\nFirst, determine whether there is enough tree cover here to keep a tree house hidden.\nTo do this, you need to count the number of trees that are visible from outside the grid when looking directly along a row or column.\n\nThe Elves have already launched a quadcopter to generate a map with the height of each tree (your puzzle input).\nFor example:\n\n30373\n25512\n65332\n33549\n35390\n\nEach tree is represented as a single digit whose value is its height, where 0 is the shortest and 9 is the tallest.\n\nA tree is visible if all of the other trees between it and an edge of the grid are shorter than it.\nOnly consider trees in the same row or column; that is, only look up, down, left, or right from any given tree.\n\nAll of the trees around the edge of the grid are visible - since they are already on the edge, there are no trees to block the view.\nIn this example, that only leaves the interior nine trees to consider:\n\nThe top-left 5 is visible from the left and top.\n(It isn't visible from the right or bottom since other trees of height 5 are in the way.)\nThe top-middle 5 is visible from the top and right.\nThe top-right 1 is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to only be trees of height 0 between it and an edge.\nThe left-middle 5 is visible, but only from the right.\nThe center 3 is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to be only trees of at most height 2 between it and an edge.\nThe right-middle 3 is visible from the right.\nIn the bottom row, the middle 5 is visible, but the 3 and 4 are not.\n\nWith 16 trees visible on the edge and another 5 visible in the interior, a total of 21 trees are visible in this arrangement.\n\nConsider your map; how many trees are visible from outside the grid?",

        "text": "Content with the amount of tree cover available, the Elves just need to know the best spot to build their tree house: they would like to be able to see a lot of trees.\n\nTo measure the viewing distance from a given tree, look up, down, left, and right from that tree; stop if you reach an edge or at the first tree that is the same height or taller than the tree under consideration.\n(If a tree is right on the edge, at least one of its viewing distances will be zero.)\n\nThe Elves don't care about distant trees taller than those found by the rules above; the proposed tree house has large eaves to keep it dry, so they wouldn't be able to see higher than the tree house anyway.\n\nIn the example above, consider the middle 5 in the second row:\n\n30373\n25512\n65332\n33549\n35390\n\nLooking up, its view is not blocked; it can see 1 tree (of height 3).\nLooking left, its view is blocked immediately; it can see only 1 tree (of height 5, right next to it).\nLooking right, its view is not blocked; it can see 2 trees.\nLooking down, its view is blocked eventually; it can see 2 trees (one of height 3, then the tree of height 5 that blocks its view).\n\nA tree's scenic score is found by multiplying together its viewing distance in each of the four directions.\nFor this tree, this is 4 (found by multiplying 1 * 1 * 2 * 2).\n\nHowever, you can do even better: consider the tree of height 5 in the middle of the fourth row:\n\n30373\n25512\n65332\n33549\n35390\n\nLooking up, its view is blocked at 2 trees (by another tree with a height of 5).\nLooking left, its view is not blocked; it can see 2 trees.\nLooking down, its view is also not blocked; it can see 1 tree.\nLooking right, its view is blocked at 2 trees (by a massive tree of height 9).\n\nThis tree's scenic score is 8 (2 * 2 * 1 * 2); this is the ideal spot for the tree house.\n\nConsider each tree on your map.\nWhat is the highest scenic score possible for any tree?",
