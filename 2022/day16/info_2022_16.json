        "text": "The sensors have led you to the origin of the distress signal: yet another handheld device, just like the one the Elves gave you.\nHowever, you don't see any Elves around; instead, the device is surrounded by elephants! They must have gotten lost in these tunnels, and one of the elephants apparently figured out how to turn on the distress signal.\n\nThe ground rumbles again, much stronger this time.\nWhat kind of cave is this, exactly? You scan the cave with your handheld device; it reports mostly igneous rock, some ash, pockets of pressurized gas, magma...\nthis isn't just a cave, it's a volcano!\n\nYou need to get the elephants out of here, quickly.\nYour device estimates that you have 30 minutes before the volcano erupts, so you don't have time to go back out the way you came in.\n\nYou scan the cave for other options and discover a network of pipes and pressure-release valves.\nYou aren't sure how such a system got into a volcano, but you don't have time to complain; your device produces a report (your puzzle input) of each valve's flow rate if it were opened (in pressure per minute) and the tunnels you could use to move between the valves.\n\nThere's even a valve in the room you and the elephants are currently standing in labeled AA.\nYou estimate it will take you one minute to open a single valve and one minute to follow any tunnel from one valve to another.\nWhat is the most pressure you could release?\n\nFor example, suppose you had the following scan output:\n\nValve AA has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves DD, II, BB\nValve BB has flow rate=13; tunnels lead to valves CC, AA\nValve CC has flow rate=2; tunnels lead to valves DD, BB\nValve DD has flow rate=20; tunnels lead to valves CC, AA, EE\nValve EE has flow rate=3; tunnels lead to valves FF, DD\nValve FF has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves EE, GG\nValve GG has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves FF, HH\nValve HH has flow rate=22; tunnel leads to valve GG\nValve II has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves AA, JJ\nValve JJ has flow rate=21; tunnel leads to valve II\n\nAll of the valves begin closed.\nYou start at valve AA, but it must be damaged or jammed or something: its flow rate is 0, so there's no point in opening it.\nHowever, you could spend one minute moving to valve BB and another minute opening it; doing so would release pressure during the remaining 28 minutes at a flow rate of 13, a total eventual pressure release of 28 * 13 = 364.\nThen, you could spend your third minute moving to valve CC and your fourth minute opening it, providing an additional 26 minutes of eventual pressure release at a flow rate of 2, or 52 total pressure released by valve CC.\n\nMaking your way through the tunnels like this, you could probably open many or all of the valves by the time 30 minutes have elapsed.\nHowever, you need to release as much pressure as possible, so you'll need to be methodical.\nInstead, consider this approach:\n\n== Minute 1 ==\nNo valves are open.\nYou move to valve DD.\n\n== Minute 2 ==\nNo valves are open.\nYou open valve DD.\n\n== Minute 3 ==\nValve DD is open, releasing 20 pressure.\nYou move to valve CC.\n\n== Minute 4 ==\nValve DD is open, releasing 20 pressure.\nYou move to valve BB.\n\n== Minute 5 ==\nValve DD is open, releasing 20 pressure.\nYou open valve BB.\n\n== Minute 6 ==\nValves BB and DD are open, releasing 33 pressure.\nYou move to valve AA.\n\n== Minute 7 ==\nValves BB and DD are open, releasing 33 pressure.\nYou move to valve II.\n\n== Minute 8 ==\nValves BB and DD are open, releasing 33 pressure.\nYou move to valve JJ.\n\n== Minute 9 ==\nValves BB and DD are open, releasing 33 pressure.\nYou open valve JJ.\n\n== Minute 10 ==\nValves BB, DD, and JJ are open, releasing 54 pressure.\nYou move to valve II.\n\n== Minute 11 ==\nValves BB, DD, and JJ are open, releasing 54 pressure.\nYou move to valve AA.\n\n== Minute 12 ==\nValves BB, DD, and JJ are open, releasing 54 pressure.\nYou move to valve DD.\n\n== Minute 13 ==\nValves BB, DD, and JJ are open, releasing 54 pressure.\nYou move to valve EE.\n\n== Minute 14 ==\nValves BB, DD, and JJ are open, releasing 54 pressure.\nYou move to valve FF.\n\n== Minute 15 ==\nValves BB, DD, and JJ are open, releasing 54 pressure.\nYou move to valve GG.\n\n== Minute 16 ==\nValves BB, DD, and JJ are open, releasing 54 pressure.\nYou move to valve HH.\n\n== Minute 17 ==\nValves BB, DD, and JJ are open, releasing 54 pressure.\nYou open valve HH.\n\n== Minute 18 ==\nValves BB, DD, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 76 pressure.\nYou move to valve GG.\n\n== Minute 19 ==\nValves BB, DD, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 76 pressure.\nYou move to valve FF.\n\n== Minute 20 ==\nValves BB, DD, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 76 pressure.\nYou move to valve EE.\n\n== Minute 21 ==\nValves BB, DD, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 76 pressure.\nYou open valve EE.\n\n== Minute 22 ==\nValves BB, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 79 pressure.\nYou move to valve DD.\n\n== Minute 23 ==\nValves BB, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 79 pressure.\nYou move to valve CC.\n\n== Minute 24 ==\nValves BB, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 79 pressure.\nYou open valve CC.\n\n== Minute 25 ==\nValves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 81 pressure.\n\n== Minute 26 ==\nValves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 81 pressure.\n\n== Minute 27 ==\nValves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 81 pressure.\n\n== Minute 28 ==\nValves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 81 pressure.\n\n== Minute 29 ==\nValves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 81 pressure.\n\n== Minute 30 ==\nValves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing 81 pressure.\n\nThis approach lets you release the most pressure possible in 30 minutes with this valve layout, 1651.\n\nWork out the steps to release the most pressure in 30 minutes.\nWhat is the most pressure you can release?",
