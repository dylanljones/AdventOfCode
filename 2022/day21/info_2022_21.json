        "text": "The monkeys are back! You're worried they're going to try to steal your stuff again, but it seems like they're just holding their ground and making various monkey noises at you.\n\nEventually, one of the elephants realizes you don't speak monkey and comes over to interpret.\nAs it turns out, they overheard you talking about trying to find the grove; they can show you a shortcut if you answer their riddle.\n\nEach monkey is given a job: either to yell a specific number or to yell the result of a math operation.\nAll of the number-yelling monkeys know their number from the start; however, the math operation monkeys need to wait for two other monkeys to yell a number, and those two other monkeys might also be waiting on other monkeys.\n\nYour job is to work out the number the monkey named root will yell before the monkeys figure it out themselves.\n\nFor example:\n\nroot: pppw + sjmn\ndbpl: 5\ncczh: sllz + lgvd\nzczc: 2\nptdq: humn - dvpt\ndvpt: 3\nlfqf: 4\nhumn: 5\nljgn: 2\nsjmn: drzm * dbpl\nsllz: 4\npppw: cczh / lfqf\nlgvd: ljgn * ptdq\ndrzm: hmdt - zczc\nhmdt: 32\n\nEach line contains the name of a monkey, a colon, and then the job of that monkey:\n\nA lone number means the monkey's job is simply to yell that number.\nA job like aaaa + bbbb means the monkey waits for monkeys aaaa and bbbb to yell each of their numbers; the monkey then yells the sum of those two numbers.\naaaa - bbbb means the monkey yells aaaa's number minus bbbb's number.\nJob aaaa * bbbb will yell aaaa's number multiplied by bbbb's number.\nJob aaaa / bbbb will yell aaaa's number divided by bbbb's number.\n\nSo, in the above example, monkey drzm has to wait for monkeys hmdt and zczc to yell their numbers.\nFortunately, both hmdt and zczc have jobs that involve simply yelling a single number, so they do this immediately: 32 and 2.\nMonkey drzm can then yell its number by finding 32 minus 2: 30.\n\nThen, monkey sjmn has one of its numbers (30, from monkey drzm), and already has its other number, 5, from dbpl.\nThis allows it to yell its own number by finding 30 multiplied by 5: 150.\n\nThis process continues until root yells a number: 152.\n\nHowever, your actual situation involves considerably more monkeys.\nWhat number will the monkey named root yell?",

        "text": "Due to some kind of monkey-elephant-human mistranslation, you seem to have misunderstood a few key details about the riddle.\n\nFirst, you got the wrong job for the monkey named root; specifically, you got the wrong math operation.\nThe correct operation for monkey root should be =, which means that it still listens for two numbers (from the same two monkeys as before), but now checks that the two numbers match.\n\nSecond, you got the wrong monkey for the job starting with humn:.\nIt isn't a monkey - it's you.\nActually, you got the job wrong, too: you need to figure out what number you need to yell so that root's equality check passes.\n(The number that appears after humn: in your input is now irrelevant.)\n\nIn the above example, the number you need to yell to pass root's equality test is 301.\n(This causes root to get the same number, 150, from both of its monkeys.)\n\nWhat number do you yell to pass root's equality test?",
