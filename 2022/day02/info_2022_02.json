        "text": "The Elves begin to set up camp on the beach.\nTo decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.\n\nRock Paper Scissors is a game between two players.\nEach game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape.\nThen, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock.\nIf both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.\n\nAppreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win.\n\"The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors.\nThe second column--\" Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone's tent.\n\nThe second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors.\nWinning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.\n\nThe winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score.\nYour total score is the sum of your scores for each round.\nThe score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).\n\nSince you can't be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.\n\nFor example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:\n\nA Y\nB X\nC Z\n\nThis strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:\n\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y).\nThis ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).\nIn the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X).\nThis ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).\nThe third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nIn this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).\n\nWhat would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?",

        "text": "The Elf finishes helping with the tent and sneaks back over to you.\n\"Anyway, the second column says how the round needs to end: X means you need to lose, Y means you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means you need to win.\nGood luck!\"\n\nThe total score is still calculated in the same way, but now you need to figure out what shape to choose so the round ends as indicated.\nThe example above now goes like this:\n\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you need the round to end in a draw (Y), so you also choose Rock.\nThis gives you a score of 1 + 3 = 4.\nIn the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you choose Rock so you lose (X) with a score of 1 + 0 = 1.\nIn the third round, you will defeat your opponent's Scissors with Rock for a score of 1 + 6 = 7.\n\nNow that you're correctly decrypting the ultra top secret strategy guide, you would get a total score of 12.\n\nFollowing the Elf's instructions for the second column, what would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?",
