        "text": "As you finally start making your way upriver, you realize your pack is much lighter than you remember.\nJust then, one of the items from your pack goes flying overhead.\nMonkeys are playing Keep Away with your missing things!\n\nTo get your stuff back, you need to be able to predict where the monkeys will throw your items.\nAfter some careful observation, you realize the monkeys operate based on how worried you are about each item.\n\nYou take some notes (your puzzle input) on the items each monkey currently has, how worried you are about those items, and how the monkey makes decisions based on your worry level.\nFor example:\n\nMonkey 0:\n  Starting items: 79, 98\n  Operation: new = old * 19\n  Test: divisible by 23\n    If true: throw to monkey 2\n    If false: throw to monkey 3\n\nMonkey 1:\n  Starting items: 54, 65, 75, 74\n  Operation: new = old + 6\n  Test: divisible by 19\n    If true: throw to monkey 2\n    If false: throw to monkey 0\n\nMonkey 2:\n  Starting items: 79, 60, 97\n  Operation: new = old * old\n  Test: divisible by 13\n    If true: throw to monkey 1\n    If false: throw to monkey 3\n\nMonkey 3:\n  Starting items: 74\n  Operation: new = old + 3\n  Test: divisible by 17\n    If true: throw to monkey 0\n    If false: throw to monkey 1\n\nEach monkey has several attributes:\n\nStarting items lists your worry level for each item the monkey is currently holding in the order they will be inspected.\nOperation shows how your worry level changes as that monkey inspects an item.\n(An operation like new = old * 5 means that your worry level after the monkey inspected the item is five times whatever your worry level was before inspection.)\nTest shows how the monkey uses your worry level to decide where to throw an item next.\n  \nIf true shows what happens with an item if the Test was true.\nIf false shows what happens with an item if the Test was false.\n\nAfter each monkey inspects an item but before it tests your worry level, your relief that the monkey's inspection didn't damage the item causes your worry level to be divided by three and rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\nThe monkeys take turns inspecting and throwing items.\nOn a single monkey's turn, it inspects and throws all of the items it is holding one at a time and in the order listed.\nMonkey 0 goes first, then monkey 1, and so on until each monkey has had one turn.\nThe process of each monkey taking a single turn is called a round.\n\nWhen a monkey throws an item to another monkey, the item goes on the end of the recipient monkey's list.\nA monkey that starts a round with no items could end up inspecting and throwing many items by the time its turn comes around.\nIf a monkey is holding no items at the start of its turn, its turn ends.\n\nIn the above example, the first round proceeds as follows:\n\nMonkey 0:\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 79.\n    Worry level is multiplied by 19 to 1501.\n    Monkey gets bored with item.\nWorry level is divided by 3 to 500.\n    Current worry level is not divisible by 23.\n    Item with worry level 500 is thrown to monkey 3.\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 98.\n    Worry level is multiplied by 19 to 1862.\n    Monkey gets bored with item.\nWorry level is divided by 3 to 620.\n    Current worry level is not divisible by 23.\n    Item with worry level 620 is thrown to monkey 3.\nMonkey 1:\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 54.\n    Worry level increases by 6 to 60.\n    Monkey gets bored with item.\nWorry level is divided by 3 to 20.\n    Current worry level is not divisible by 19.\n    Item with worry level 20 is thrown to monkey 0.\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 65.\n    Worry level increases by 6 to 71.\n    Monkey gets bored with item.\nWorry level is divided by 3 to 23.\n    Current worry level is not divisible by 19.\n    Item with worry level 23 is thrown to monkey 0.\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry

is thrown to monkey 0.\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 74.\n    Worry level increases by 6 to 80.\n    Monkey gets bored with item.\nWorry level is divided by 3 to 26.\n    Current worry level is not divisible by 19.\n    Item with worry level 26 is thrown to monkey 0.\nMonkey 2:\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 79.\n    Worry level is multiplied by itself to 6241.\n    Monkey gets bored with item.\nWorry level is divided by 3 to 2080.\n    Current worry level is divisible by 13.\n    Item with worry level 2080 is thrown to monkey 1.\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 60.\n    Worry level is multiplied by itself to 3600.\n    Monkey gets bored with item.\nWorry level is divided by 3 to 1200.\n    Current worry level is not divisible by 13.\n    Item with worry level 1200 is thrown to monkey 3.\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 97.\n    Worry level is multiplied by itself to 9409.\n    Monkey gets bored with

is thrown to monkey 1.\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 500.\n    Worry level increases by 3 to 503.\n    Monkey gets bored with item.\nWorry level is divided by 3 to 167.\n    Current worry level is not divisible by 17.\n    Item with worry level 167 is thrown to monkey 1.\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 620.\n    Worry level increases by 3 to 623.\n    Monkey gets

level of 1200.\n    Worry level increases by 3 to 1203.\n    Monkey gets bored with item.\nWorry level is divided by 3 to 401.\n    Current worry level is not divisible by 17.\n    Item with worry level 401 is thrown to monkey 1.\n  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 3136.\n    Worry level increases by 3 to 3139.\n    Monkey gets bored with item.\nWorry level is divided by 3 to 1046.\n    Current worry level is not divisible by 17.\n    Item with worry level 1046 is thrown to monkey 1.\n\nAfter round 1, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:\n\nMonkey 0: 20, 23, 27, 26\nMonkey 1: 2080, 25, 167, 207, 401, 1046\nMonkey 2: \nMonkey 3:\n\nMonkeys 2 and 3 aren't holding any items at the end of the round; they both inspected items during the round and threw

times.\nMonkey 2 inspected items 7 times.\nMonkey 3 inspected items 105 times.\n\nIn this example, the two most active monkeys inspected items 101 and 105 times.\nThe level of monkey business in this
