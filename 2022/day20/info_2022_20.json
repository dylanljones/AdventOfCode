        "text": "It's finally time to meet back up with the Elves.\nWhen you try to contact them, however, you get no reply.\nPerhaps you're out of range?\n\nYou know they're headed to the grove where the star fruit grows, so if you can figure out where that is, you should be able to meet back up with them.\n\nFortunately, your handheld device has a file (your puzzle input) that contains the grove's coordinates! Unfortunately, the file is encrypted - just in case the device were to fall into the wrong hands.\n\nMaybe you can decrypt it?\n\nWhen you were still back at the camp, you overheard some Elves talking about coordinate file encryption.\nThe main operation involved in decrypting the file is called mixing.\n\nThe encrypted file is a list of numbers.\nTo mix the file, move each number forward or backward in the file a number of positions equal to the value of the number being moved.\nThe list is circular, so moving a number off one end of the list wraps back around to the other end as if the ends were connected.\n\nFor example, to move the 1 in a sequence like 4, 5, 6, 1, 7, 8, 9, the 1 moves one position forward: 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 8, 9.\nTo move the -2 in a sequence like 4, -2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the -2 moves two positions backward, wrapping around: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, -2, 9.\n\nThe numbers should be moved in the order they originally appear in the encrypted file.\nNumbers moving around during the mixing process do not change the order in which the numbers are moved.\n\nConsider this encrypted file:\n\n1\n2\n-3\n3\n-2\n0\n4\n\nMixing this file proceeds as follows:\n\nInitial arrangement:\n1, 2, -3, 3, -2, 0, 4\n\n1 moves between 2 and -3:\n2, 1, -3, 3, -2, 0, 4\n\n2 moves between -3 and 3:\n1, -3, 2, 3, -2, 0, 4\n\n-3 moves between -2 and 0:\n1, 2, 3, -2, -3, 0, 4\n\n3 moves between 0 and 4:\n1, 2, -2, -3, 0, 3, 4\n\n-2 moves between 4 and 1:\n1, 2, -3, 0, 3, 4, -2\n\n0 does not move:\n1, 2, -3, 0, 3, 4, -2\n\n4 moves between -3 and 0:\n1, 2, -3, 4, 0, 3, -2\n\nThen, the grove coordinates can be found by looking at the 1000th, 2000th, and 3000th numbers after the value 0, wrapping around the list as necessary.\nIn the above example, the 1000th number after 0 is 4, the 2000th is -3, and the 3000th is 2; adding these together produces 3.\n\nMix your encrypted file exactly once.\nWhat is the sum of the three numbers that form the grove coordinates?",
