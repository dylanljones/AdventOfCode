        "text": "You try contacting the Elves using your handheld device, but the river you're following must be too low to get a decent signal.\n\nYou ask the device for a heightmap of the surrounding area (your puzzle input).\nThe heightmap shows the local area from above broken into a grid; the elevation of each square of the grid is given by a single lowercase letter, where a is the lowest elevation, b is the next-lowest, and so on up to the highest elevation, z.\n\nAlso included on the heightmap are marks for your current position (S) and the location that should get the best signal (E).\nYour current position (S) has elevation a, and the location that should get the best signal (E) has elevation z.\n\nYou'd like to reach E, but to save energy, you should do it in as few steps as possible.\nDuring each step, you can move exactly one square up, down, left, or right.\nTo avoid needing to get out your climbing gear, the elevation of the destination square can be at most one higher than the elevation of your current square; that is, if your current elevation is m, you could step to elevation n, but not to elevation o.\n(This also means that the elevation of the destination square can be much lower than the elevation of your current square.)\n\nFor example:\n\nSabqponm\nabcryxxl\naccszExk\nacctuvwj\nabdefghi\n\nHere, you start in the top-left corner; your goal is near the middle.\nYou could start by moving down or right, but eventually you'll need to head toward the e at the bottom.\nFrom there, you can spiral around to the goal:\n\nv..v<<<<\n>v.vv<<^\n.>vv>E^^\n..v>>>^^\n..>>>>>^\n\nIn the above diagram, the symbols indicate whether the path exits each square moving up (^), down (v), left (<), or right (>).\nThe location that should get the best signal is still E, and .\nmarks unvisited squares.\n\nThis path reaches the goal in 31 steps, the fewest possible.\n\nWhat is the fewest steps required to move from your current position to the location that should get the best signal?",
